<p><h2>Description</h2></p>
<p>Jollof Rice is a popular West African dish made with rice cooked in a rich, flavorful tomato sauce.

The dish is often served with fried plantains, grilled chicken, or fish. Known for its vibrant flavor and cultural significance, Jollof Rice is a staple at parties, family gatherings, and celebrations across many African countries, each with its own unique twist on the recipe.</p>
<p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
<p>
<ul>
   <li> 2 cups of long-grain parboiled rice</li>
<li>4 large tomatoes (or 1 can of blended tomatoes)</li>
<li>2 red bell peppers</li>
<li>1–2 Scotch bonnet (ata rodo) or chili peppers (for heat)</li>
<li>1 large onion (half for blending, half for frying)</li>
<li>3 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
<li>2–3 cups chicken or vegetable stock</li>
<li>1 teaspoon thyme</li>
<li>1 teaspoon curry powder</li>
<li>2–3 bay leaves</li>
<li>1 teaspoon paprika (optional)</li>
<li>Salt (to taste)</li>
<li>2 seasoning cubes (e.g., Maggi or Knorr)</li>
<li>1/4 cup vegetable or sunflower oil</li>
<li>Cooked chicken, beef, or fish (optional, for serving)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><h3>Preparation Steps</h3></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Blend the sauce:</b> Blend the tomatoes, red bell peppers, Scotch bonnet, and half of the onion into a smooth puree. Set aside.</li>
<li><b>Prepare the base:</b> Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the remaining chopped onions and fry until fragrant and slightly golden.</li>
<li><b>Add tomato paste:</b> Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 2–3 minutes. This helps deepen the flavor and color of the rice.</li>
<li><b>Add blended mixture:</b> Pour in the blended tomato-pepper mixture. Cook on medium heat for 10–15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens and the raw tomato taste disappears.</li>
<li><b>Season the sauce:</b> Add thyme, curry powder, bay leaves, paprika (if using), seasoning cubes, and salt. Stir well to combine.</li>
<li><b>Add stock and rice:</b> Pour in the chicken or vegetable stock, then add the washed rice. Stir so the sauce coats the rice evenly.</li>
<li><b>Cook the rice:</b> Cover the pot tightly with foil or a lid to trap steam. Cook on low heat for about 25–30 minutes. Avoid stirring too often to prevent the rice from becoming mushy.</li>
<li><b>Check and finish:</b> When the rice is soft and the liquid absorbed, gently stir to combine everything evenly. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed.</li>
<li><b>Serve and enjoy:</b> Serve hot with fried plantains, grilled chicken, beef, or fish.</li>
