<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<p><b>For the Rice:</b></p>
<li>2 cups long-grain rice</li>
<li>4 cups water</li>
<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil or butter (optional)</li>
<p><b>For the Stew:</b></p>
<li>5 medium-sized tomatoes (or 1 can of blended tomatoes)</li>
<li>2 red bell peppers</li>
<li>1–2 Scotch bonnet (ata rodo) or chili peppers (for spice)</li>
<li>1 large onion</li>
<li>2–3 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
<li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
<li>500g beef, chicken, or fish (your choice)</li>
<li>1 teaspoon curry powder</li>
<li>1 teaspoon thyme</li>
<li>2 seasoning cubes</li>
<li>Salt to taste</li>
</ul>
<h3>Preparation Steps</h3>
<ol>
<p><b>Step 1: Cook the Rice</b></p>
<li>Wash the rice thoroughly in cold water to remove excess starch.</li>
<li>In a pot, add 4 cups of water, salt, and a little oil (optional).</li>
<li>Bring to a boil, then add the rice.</li>
<li>Cook on medium heat until the rice is soft and all the water is absorbed.</li>
<li>Fluff with a fork and set aside.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<p><b>Step 2: Prepare the Stew</b></p>
<li><b>Blend the base:</b> Blend the tomatoes, red bell peppers, Scotch bonnet, and onion until smooth.</li>
<li><b>Cook the meat:</b> Season your beef or chicken with salt, seasoning cubes, curry powder, and thyme. Boil until tender, then set aside. Keep the stock (broth) for flavor.</li>
<li><b>Fry the sauce:</b> Heat the vegetable oil in a pot. Add the tomato paste and fry for 2–3 minutes. Pour in the blended mixture and cook on medium heat for about 10–15 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent burning.</li>
<li><b>Season the stew:</b> Add salt, seasoning cubes, thyme, and curry powder. Stir well and continue cooking until the oil begins to float on top — this means the stew is ready.</li>
<li><b>Add the meat:</b> Add your cooked beef or chicken (and a little of the stock) into the stew. Let it simmer for 5–10 minutes so the flavors combine beautifully.</li>
<li><b>Serve:</b>Scoop the rice onto a plate and pour the rich tomato stew beside it.</li>
